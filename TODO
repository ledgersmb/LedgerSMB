Near immediate items (release-delaying?).  * indicates completed.
- *project  name
- *revision control
- *add not null constraint to acc_trans.chart_id
- *Change acc_trans.amount to NUMERIC
- *Update SL-Basic.tex tarball to be the new manual for LedgerSMB
- *coding standard
- *fix the session security problem in the main application
- *Tightened browser caching rules so that the back button is no problem.
- *hosting, Sourceforge import SVN (almost done)
- *solve security problem for admin.pl (central db?)  
	Suggest starting with a simple server-side cookie.  Then when we
	add authentication abstraction, this problem can be permanently
	solved in a modular fashion.
- * finish removing references to sql-ledger 
- *write upgrade/crossgrade script from SL -> LedgerSMB (mostly done)
	Database script is done.  Just untar over the top?
	If so, then this is done.
- *write press release
- *write SL List announcement
- *CONTRIBUTORS/AUTHORS file.
- *Delete setup.pl file for released versions. (not in SVN). (via the SL2LS.pl)
- *Run final tests on applications
  - *crossgrade script-- missing SL directory unlink logic.
  - *templates
  - *db upgrade 
- *Fix printing bug with LaTeX templates.  Error:
	Quantifier follows nothing in regex; 
	marked by <-- HERE in m/? <-- HERE / at LedgerSMB/Form.pm line 1107.

Higher priorities
- Move all other floats to NUMERICs in the database schemas.
- Create a new naming system that allows us to track db schema changes between
    different versions of SQL-Ledger and LedgerSMB and 
- update setup.pl, which has a lot of SL specific code.
- make utf-8 default
- Add protection against duplicate id values. 
    Chris Travers has a fix that will be applied in the next version but will
    require some extensive testing.
- Batch printing of Checks
    Chris Travers has done this work for another customer for 2.6.15 and can 
    move this code over quickly.
- Prevent printing without posting. 
- Add last cost field to laber/overhead creation screen.
- drop Oracle support? 
    Oracle support is already largely abandoned.  Not sure if we should
    drop the code though... Chris Travers
- code cleanup (move to established coding standards, not structural yet)
- xhtml compliant code
- central default database (maybe authentication abstraction here?)
- Integrate a sales data report.
    Available as a diff at http://www.metatrontech.com/projects/
- Bundle script for generating email reports when parts are low.
    To be included in next version.  Work is already done.
- Fix reconcilliation summary report.
- Remove Dieter's sessionid timestamp since it serves no purpose.
- authentication abstraction for Kerberos, LDAP authentication, and the like.
- Authentication module for PostgreSQL databases.
- Account transactions available from Balance Sheets and Income Statements via 
links.
- Replace the defaults table with one that is more normalized.
- Fix printing for Windows. 
  This turns out to be incredibly trivial.
- Make batch printing more readible.

Medium-longer term
- Database schema cleanup/rewrite
- Move all config information onto the Form object.
- Port SL-POS functionality into the fork.
- published API
- Command-line wrapper that is easy to use....
- SOAP or HTTP based interfaces (OpenLedger?)
- Credit Card Processing
- Tighten up integrity controls in schema by replacing the insert/update with
  a single insert and adding foreign keys.
- Portable Data Terminal integration.
- Merge web directories so that maintaining frames and no-frames browsers 
  is not a problem.
	No-frame browsers are important in some areas where screen resolution
	is limited and text-based keyboard entry is used.  I don't think
	support should be dropped for these browsers-- Chris Travers.
- Move to a template-based display system with main application logic being in
  a separate Perl module.
- Convert to use persistant database connections.
- Basic payroll module
- Multiple Shipto's associated with customers/vendors.
