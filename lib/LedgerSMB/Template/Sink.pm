=head1 METHODS

=head2 append( $template, %arguments )

Makes the sink consume an evaluated C<$template>. Additional arguments
may be provided using named arguments. See the specification of the
specific subclass for details on supported and required additional
arguments.

Returns a L<Workflow> instance if one has been created, or C<undef>
otherwise.

=cut

sub append { }

=head2 render()

Returns a PSGI triplet containing the cumulated state of the sink,
if it can be represented as such, or C<undef> if not. An example of such
accumulated state to be returned as PSGI triplet, is the collection of
templates into a ZIP file, where the ZIP is the return value.
