yet been saved in the database.

=cut

=item description

This is the human-readible type description.  It must be unique among types.

=cut

=cut

sub get {

                                            args => [$id]

    $self->prepare_dbhash($ref);
    return $self->new($ref);
}

=item save

changed in the process.

=cut

    return $self->get($id);
}


=item list

Returns a list of all exchange rate types.

=cut

sub list {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my @classes = $self->call_procedure(

    for my $class (@classes){
        $self->prepare_dbhash($class);
        $class = $self->new(%$class);
    }
