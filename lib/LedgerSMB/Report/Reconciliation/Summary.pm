=head1 DESCRIPTION

This report allows for searching reconciliation reports.  The reports are then
accessed by clicking on the hyperlinks and can be then approved or denied.

LedgerSMB follows a two-stage bank reconciliation process.  In the first stage,
the reconciliation data is entered, reviewed by the one who entered it, and
submitted for approval.  Prior to submission the data entry individual can
continue to work on the reconciliation report, entering missing items, etc.
After this is submitted, the only possible options are approval or removal.

This report is typically used in two contexts.  The first is in the approval
process, where this provides the basic search routines.  The second is in
checking past reconciliation report information to see what exactly was
reconciled in a specific report.
