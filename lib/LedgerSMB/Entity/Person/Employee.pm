=head1 METHODS

=over

=item get($entity_id)

This does not need to be a blessed reference.  It does return a reference
blessed if the employee is found or undef otherwise.

=cut

sub get {
    my ($self, $id) = @_;
    my ($ref) = __PACKAGE__->call_procedure(funcname => 'employee__get',
                                          args => [$id]);
    return undef unless $ref->{control_code};
    $ref->{entity_class} = 3;
    $ref->{name} = "$ref->{first_name} $ref->{last_name}";
    return __PACKAGE__->new(%$ref);
}

=item get_by_cc($control_code);

Similar to get above but accepts as input the control code rather than the
entity_id.

=cut

sub get_by_cc {
    my ($self, $cc) = @_;
    my ($ref) = __PACKAGE__->call_procedure(funcname => 'person__get_by_cc',
                                          args => [$cc]);
    return undef unless $ref->{control_code};
    return get($ref->{id});
}

=item save()

Saves the employee.  Must be a blessed reference.

=cut

sub save {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my ($ref) = $self->call_dbmethod(funcname => 'person__save');
    my ($id) = values(%$ref);
    $self->entity_id($id);
    return $self->call_dbmethod(funcname => 'employee__save');
