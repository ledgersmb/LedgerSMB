=head1 DESCRIPTION

leads, and more.  Notes are expected to be read-only, and essentially
append-only.

This module handles attaching notes either at the entity level or the credit id
level.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item list($entity_id, [$credit_id])

Lists all bank accounts for entity_id.  This does not need to be performed on a
blessed reference.  All return results are objects.

=cut

sub list{
    my ($self, $entity_id, $credit_id) = @_;
    my @results;
    if ($credit_id){
        @results = __PACKAGE__->call_procedure(funcname =>
             'eca__list_notes', args => [$credit_id]);
    } else {
        @results = __PACKAGE__->call_procedure(funcname =>
             'entity__list_notes', args => [$entity_id]);
    }
    for my $row(@results){
        $row = __PACKAGE__->new(%$row);
    }
    return @results;
}

=item save()

Saves the bank account object to the database and reinstantiates it, thus
setting things like the id field.

=cut

sub save {
    my ($self) = @_;
    my $ref;
    if ( NC_ENTITY_CREDIT_ACCOUNT == $self->note_class){
        ($ref) = $self->call_dbmethod(funcname => 'eca__save_notes');
    } else {
        ($ref) = $self->call_dbmethod(funcname => 'entity__save_notes');
    }
    return $ref;
}
