=head1 NAME

LedgerSMB::Magic - Magic number constants for LedgerSMB

=head1 DESCRIPTION

I<LedgerSMB::Magic> is a library of constants used by the
LedgerSMB system.  Mostly, these are peculiar to LedgerSMB,
but where a small part of of a published code is used, the
constants may be found here rather than separate modules.

=head1 SYNOPSIS

 use LedgerSMB::Magic qw( EC_EMPLOYEE );

 if ($entity_code == EC_EMPLOYEE) {
     print "This entity  is an employee.";
 }

=head1 METHODS

This module doesn't specify any (public) methods.

=head1  ACCEPTED NUMERIC LITERALS

Numeric literal values that are not considered magical in LedgerSMB code.

    -1  for use as a fat minus or array index
     0
     1
     2
     100 for use finding percentages or shifting monetary values

=head1 CONSTANTS

The following constant functions are available.  None are exported by
default.
