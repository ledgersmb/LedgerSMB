Feature: Reconciliation
  As a LedgerSMB user I want to be able to create a new bank reconciliation
  report, save it, review it and delete it.

Background:
  Given a standard test company
    And a logged in admin user

Scenario: Create new reconciliation report, update and save.
This scenario tests reconciling an account for the first time, where there
is no previous report from which to get an opening balance.
 Given the following GL transaction posted on 2017-11-01:
     | accno   |  debit_bc |  credit_bc  |
     | 1065    |   200.00  |             |
     | 1060    |           |   200.00    |
 And the following GL transaction posted on 2017-11-02:
     | accno   |  debit_bc |  credit_bc  |
     | 1060    |  1000.00  |             |
     | 2620    |           |  1000.00    |
  When I navigate the menu and select the item at "Cash > Reconciliation"
  Then I should see the New Reconciliation Report screen.
  When I select "1060 Checking Account" from the drop down "Account"
   And I enter "1000.00" into "Statement Balance"
   And I enter "2018-01-01" into "Statement Date"
   And I press "Create New Report"
  Then I should see the Reconciliation Report screen
   And I should see these Reconciliation Report headings:
       | Heading                     |              Contents |
       | Account                     | 1060 Checking Account |
       | Statement Date              |            2018-01-01 |
       | Beginning Statement Balance |                  0.00 |
       | Ending Statement Balance    |               1000.00 |
       | Variance                    |              -1000.00 |
       | Less Outstanding Checks     |               -800.00 |
       | Report Generated By         |            $$the user |
   And I expect the Cleared Transactions totals to be:
       | Books Debits | Books Credits |
       |         0.00 |          0.00 |
   And I expect the Outstanding Transactions totals to be:
       | Our Debits | Our Credits |
       |    1000.00 |      200.00 |
  When I press "Select All"
  Then I should see these Reconciliation Report headings:
       | Heading                     |              Contents |
       | Account                     | 1060 Checking Account |
       | Statement Date              |            2018-01-01 |
       | Beginning Statement Balance |                  0.00 |
       | Ending Statement Balance    |               1000.00 |
       | Variance                    |               -200.00 |
       | Less Outstanding Checks     |                  0.00 |
       | Report Generated By         |            $$the user |
   And I expect the Cleared Transactions totals to be:
       | Books Debits | Books Credits |
       |      1000.00 |        200.00 |
   And I expect the Outstanding Transactions section to be absent
  When I change the "Ending Statement Balance" to "800.00"
   And I update the page
  Then I should see these Reconciliation Report headings:
       | Heading                     |              Contents |
       | Account                     | 1060 Checking Account |
       | Statement Date              |            2018-01-01 |

       | Variance                    |                  0.00 |
       | Less Outstanding Checks     |                  0.00 |
       | Report Generated By         |            $$the user |
  When I press "Save"
  Then I should see the Search Reconciliation Reports screen

Scenario: Search for reconciliation report and delete it,
 Given reconciliation reports with these properties:
       | Account Number | Statement Date | Statement Balance | Approved | Submitted |
       | 1060           | 2018-01-01     | 101.00            | no       | no        |
