Feature: Reconciliation Report Search
  As a LedgerSMB user I want to be able to search for reconciliation
  reports according to various attributes.

Background:
  Given a standard test company named "standard-recon-test"
    And a logged in admin user
    And reconciliation reports with these properties:
       | Account Number | Statement Date | Statement Balance | Approved | Submitted |
       | 1060           | 2018-01-01     | 1000.00           | no       | no        |
       | 1060           | 2018-02-01     | 1000.01           | no       | yes       |
       | 1060           | 2018-03-01     | 1000.02           | yes      | yes       |
       | 1065           | 2018-01-01     | 100.00            | no       | no        |
