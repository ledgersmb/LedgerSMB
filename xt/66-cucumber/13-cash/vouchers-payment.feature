  batch to see what payments it contains.

###TODO: This test was dependent on the previous one
# Also, there's an important underlying question: should we test
# transaction approval as part of the original functionality or is it
# a separate functionality to be tested?
# Scenario: Review the contents of an existing batch
#   When I navigate the menu and select the item at "Transaction Approval > Batches"
#   Then I should see the Search Batches screen
#   When I enter "Test Batch" into "Description"
#    And I press "Search"
#   Then I should see the Batch Search Report screen
#    And I expect the report to contain 1 row
#    And I expect the 'Payment Amount' report column to contain '126.00' for Batch Number 'B-1001'
