Feature: correct operation of the menu and immediate linked pages
  As an end-user, I want to be able to navigate the menu and open
  the screens from the available links. If my authorizations
  don't allow a specific screen, I expect the links not to be in
  the menu.



Background:
  Given a standard test company


Scenario Outline: Navigate to menu and open screen
  Given a logged in admin
   When I navigate the menu and select the item at "<path>"
   Then I should see the <screen> screen
  Examples:
    | path                                      | screen                   |
