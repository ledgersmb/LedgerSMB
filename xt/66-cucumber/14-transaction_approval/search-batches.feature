Feature: Search Batches
  As a LedgerSMB user I want to be able to search for previously created
  voucher batches according to parameters which I specify, with the results
  presented as a list.

Background:
  Given a standard test company named "standard-batch-test"
    And batches with these properties:
       | Type    | Date       | Batch Number | Description | Approved |
       | ap      | 2018-01-01 | B-1001       | Batch-1     | no       |
       | ar      | 2018-02-01 | B-1002       | Batch-ABC-2 | no       |
       | payment | 2018-03-01 | B-1003       | Batch-3     | no       |
       | payment | 2018-04-01 | B-1004       | Batch-4     | yes      |
    And a logged in admin user

Scenario: Search for all unapproved batches
  When I navigate the menu and select the item at "Transaction Approval > Batches"
  Then I should see the Search Batches screen

  Then I should see the Batch Search Report screen
   And I should see these headings:
       | Heading             | Contents     |
