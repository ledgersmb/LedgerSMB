    # First series of tests, AR before AP

    This test concerns 3 invoices:

    1. id=-1201; AR invoice
    2. id=-1202; AP invoice
    3. id=-1203, the second AR invoice
    4. id=-1204, the second AP invoice
    5. id=-1205, the third AP invoice

    Summary of steps:

    1. sell 100 items (back-order: 100)
    2. purchase 75 items (back-order: 25 / invoice -1201)
    3. sell 100 items (back-order: 25 @ -1201 / 100 @ -1203)
    4. purchase 75 (back-order: 0 @ -1201 / 50 @ -1203)
    5. purchase 50 (back-order: 0)

    -- Step 3:  Reversal of AP invoice with allocation (reallocates to invoice without and removes AR allocation)

    -- TODO
    -- Test outline:
    --  * Set up an ap invoice and an ar invoice, each at 150 units
    --  * Allocate these against each other
    --  * Set up another ap invoice at 75 units
    --  * Allocate the new invoice / no units available == no effect
    --  * Reverse the original AP invoice at 150 units
    --  * Allocate the reversal invoice
    --  * The second AP invoice is now allocated
    --  * The AR invoice is 50% de-allocated
