The load order for the files is documented in sql/modules/LOADORDER

Also Roles.sql MUST be run last because portions of it depend on function
declarations in the other scripts.

The file sql/modules/BLACKLIST lists all functions expected to exist in
the schema. It is created by the script tools/makeblacklist.pl
