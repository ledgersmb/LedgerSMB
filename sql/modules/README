The load order for the files is documented in sql/modules/LOADORDER

Also Roles.sql MUST be run last because portions of it depend on function
declarations in the other scripts.

The file sql/modules/BLACKLIST lists all functions expected to exist in
the schema.  This is used to test that functions have not been overloaded
(that there are not multiple functions with the same name, but different
parameters), which our object mapper does not handle. The file is created
by the script `utils/test/makeblacklist.pl`.
