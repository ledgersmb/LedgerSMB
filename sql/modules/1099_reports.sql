-- First a couple of notes about this file and what will probably change in the
-- future.
--
-- The current generation here of reports assumes that we are providing
-- reporting of purchases or sales to one country only.  If this ever changes
-- we will need an abstraction layer like we use with fixed assets.  I suspect
-- we will go that way anyway since it will make some things easier.
--
-- This file provides 1099 reporting (MISC and INT).  It does NOT provide 1099-K
-- and we'd need an abstraction layer for that. --CT
