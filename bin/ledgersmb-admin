=head1 OPTIONS

=head2 --version

=head1 CONFIGURATION

The configuration is read from the first file that exists, iterating over

    $HOME/.ledgersmb-admin.conf
    /usr/local/etc/ledgersmb-admin.conf
    /etc/ledgersmb-admin.conf

If no configuration file is found, or the configuration file doesn't specify
the all connection parameters, PostgreSQL's PG* environment variables provide
fallback values.

The configuration file format is YAML. The minimal configuration file specifies
the C<connect_data> key with C<username>, C<password> and C<company> keys,
e.g.:

   connect_data:
      username: postgres
      password: abc
      company: test

For more information on the configuration file and available configuration
keys, see the output of C<config help>.
