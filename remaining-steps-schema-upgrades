Steps in the schema upgrade branch:

** Separate commits to new infrastructure (can be squashed) from existing files!
    (the latter can't be squashed, need to be descriptive commits to become part of project history)

- change-application needs a data-source (to return values from the input form to the change applicator)
- define all formatters
- change all callees to die on error (and return status on failure)
- 

- implement tests!
  - t/16-schema-upgrade-precheck.t
    - loading change files
      * bail if required arguments haven't been provided to 'check'
      * succeed with multiple checks defined in a single file
      - TBD: fail if multiple checks in a file share the same title?
    - run checks (with no real $dbh; no formatters)
      - various combinations of succeeding and failing tests
