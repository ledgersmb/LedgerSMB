usage: $script_name --company COMPANY --pgsql-contrib DIR [option1 .. optionN]

This script wants to be run as the root user. If you don't, you'll be
asked to enter the password of the 'postgres' user

This script creates a 'ledgersmb' user on the specified PostgreSQL host,
if it does not exist.  Then it proceeds to load the LedgerSMB database
structure and content, loading Chart of Accounts data and GIFI data
as specified in the argument list.

After the database has been created, the script inserts a default user
'$ADMIN_USERNAME' (password: '$ADMIN_PASSWORD'), with these initial values:

First name:  $ADMIN_FIRSTNAME  (NULL == none)
Middle name: $ADMIN_MIDDLENAME (NULL == none)
Last name:   $ADMIN_LASTNAME   (NULL == none)
Country:     'US'

This default user will be assigned all privileges within the application.

Available options:
 --srcdir       The path where the sources for LedgerSMB are located
                [$srcdir]
 --dstdir       The path where the sources will be located when invoked
                from the webserver [$dstdir]
 --host         The PostgreSQL host to connect to (see 'man psql') [$host]
 --port         The PostgreSQL port to connect to (see 'man psql') [$port]
 --company      The name of the database to be created for the company [*]
 --owner        The name of the superuser which is to become owner of the
                company's database [$owner]
 --password     The password to be used to create the 'ledgersmb' user
                on the specified PostgreSQL server [$pass]
 --cc           The two letter country code to use [$cc]
 --coa          The chart of accounts file to load [$coa]
 --gifi         The GIFI file to load if any [$gifi]
 --help         Shows this help screen

 * These arguments don't have a default, but are required
