Known versions of software incompatible with LedgerSMB:
-------------------------------
Versions prior to PostgreSQL 8.4 do not support some features required by
LedgerSMB 1.3 and higher - support for these PostgreSQL versions has been
dropped.

-------------------------------

W3M does not handle the <BUTTON> element properly and does not work.

-------------------------------

Pocket Internet Explorer:
Pocket IE does not handle BUTTON elements so is entirely unsupported.

-------------------------------

Minimo:
Minimo's SSR settings can cause tables to be badly represented.  We recommend 
disabling SSR.  Minimo is the preferred alternative to Pocket IE.

Note that on the Symbol MC50, Minimo 0.2 does not install or run.  The cab 
installer for 0.16 does run but complains about the software being designed for
a previous version of Windows Mobile.  Once the cab installation completes, the
software can be run from the appropriate installation directory (in Program 
Files).

-------------------------------

Internet Explorer < 8.0
This browser submits incorrect data when using the <BUTTON> element and is not
supported.  Users of Windows XP and Vista may try Internet Explorer 8 or 
Firefox at their option. Users of older versions of WIndows should use Firefox.
