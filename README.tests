Test file number allocation:
00 - 09: General base checks
10 - 39: Module checks, no LSMB database required
     40: Set up test LSMB database
     41: Addons setup.  Addons should use 41.x notation where x is the run
         needed to properly install.
42 - 59: Operational checks, LSMB database required
60 - 88: Interface checks
     89: Clean up test LSMB database
90 - 99: Packaging checks

Environment variables can be used as flags to disable/enable tests >= 40

LSMB_TEST_DB must be set to a defined value if databases are going to be tested.

if LSMB_NEW_DB is set, test 40 (when it is complete) will create a database with
the name from this environment variable, and subsequent database tests will run
against that database.  If this is not set, and PGDATABASE is set, tests will 
run on that database. If neither are set, the tests will bail out.

Special notes on specific test cases:

42-dbobject.t:  Some tests will run even if LSMB_TEST_DB is not enabled.  These 
tests do not require a database connection.

43-dbtest.t:  This runs defined test cases from sql/modules/test/.  If new
scripts are added, they must be listed in this script as well.

62-api.t uses request hashes defined in t/data/62-request-data.  This
script employs a database commit filter to prevent commits to the db.  It is
safe to run on existing databases.

63-lwp.t will re-use the request hashes defined in test/data/62-request-data.
It does NOT employ a commit filter, so is NOT safe to run against production
data.  It will only run if the environment variable LSMB_TEST_LWN is set to true.

ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES USED:

Environment Variables which control which tests are run (set to true to enable):
 LSMB_TEST_DB runs database tests
LSMB_TEST_LWP runs LWP tests

Variables to set credentials:
PGUSER and PGPASSWORD for db tests
LSMB_USER and LSMB_PASS for LWP tests

Variables to configure test suites:
   PGDATABASE directs to the database (or company element in LWP tests)
LSMB_BASE_URL directs LWP tests to the main LSMB instance being tested. 

If you wish to make a new db for tests, you must set the following environment 
variables:

   LSMB_NEW_DB is the name of the new db.  If this database cannot be created, 
               the tests will bail out.
PG_CONTRIB_DIR is the address of the directory where Pg contrib scripts are 
               located.  You can find it by searching for tablefunc.sql.

Additionally, if LSMB_INSTALL_DB is set, the database will NOT be removed after
test cases are run.  This can be a useful way of installing the for production
use, though currently an admin user is not created in this process and would
need to be created manually.

When a database is created, these environment variables are used to control 
flow.  If these are not set, relevant portions are skipped.

Admin user creation:
----------------------
LSMB_ADMIN_USERNAME username for admin user
LSMB_ADMIN_PASSWORD password for admin user
   LSMB_ADMIN_FNAME Admin's first name
   LSMB_ADMIN_LNAME Admin's last name
  LSMB_COUNTRY_CODE Country code for administrator and for loading chart of 
                    accounts

Chart of accounts loading
-------------------------
    LSMB_LOAD_COA name of the Chart of Accounts file (minus the extension)
   LSMB_LOAD_GIFI name of the GIFI file (minus the extension)
LSMB_COUNTRY_CODE Country code for administrator and for loading chart of 
                  accounts
