LedgerSMB::DBOject::Payment - Payment Handling Back-end Routines for LedgerSMB

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides the functions for generating the data structures payments made in
LedgerSMB.   This module currently handles only basic payment logic, and does
handle overpayment logic, though these features will be moved into this module
in the near future.

=over

=item LedgerSMB::DBObject::Payment->new()

Inherited from LedgerSMB::DBObject.  Please see that documnetation for details.

=item $payment->get_open_accounts()

This function returns a list of open accounts depending on the
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{accounts} property.
Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and entity_class.

An account is considered open if there are outstanding, unpaid invoices
attached to it.  Customer/vendor payment threshold is not considered for this
calculation.

=over

=item get_metadata()

Prepares the object for other tasks, such as displaying payment options.

Requires that the following object properties be defined:

  * dbh
  * account_class
  * batch_id
  * payment_type_id (optional)

Sets the following object properties:

  * currencies
  * default_currency
  * businesses
  * payment_types
  * debt_accounts
  * cash_accounts
  * batch_date
  * all_years

Additionally if payment_type_id is set:

  * payment_type_label_id
  * payment_type_return_id
  * payment_type_return_label

=item $payment->get_all_accounts()

This function returns a list of open or closed accounts depending on the
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{accounts} property.

=item $payment->get_open_invoices()

This function returns a list of open invoices depending on the
$payment->{account_class}, $payment->{entity_id}, and $payment->{curr}
properties.  Account classes follow the conventions above.  This list is hence
specific to a customer or vendor and currency as well.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{open_invoices}
property. Each hashref has the following keys:  invoice_id int, invnumber text,
invoice bool, invoice_date date, amount numeric, amount_fx numeric,
discount numeric, discount_fx numeric, due numeric, due_fx numeric,
 exchangerate numeric

can search for a specific invoice, which can be searched by the $payment->{invnumber}
variable

=item $payment->get_all_contact_invoices()

This function returns a list of open accounts depending on the
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.  Attached
to each account is a list of open invoices.  The data structure is somewhat
complex.

Each item in the list has the following keys: contact_id, contact_name, \
account_number, total_due, and invoices.

The invoices entry is a reference to an array of hashrefs.  Each of these
hashrefs has the following keys: invoice_id, invnumber, invoice_date, amount,
discount, and due.

These are filtered based on the (required) properties:
$payment->{account_class}, $payment->{business_type}, $payment->{date_from},
$payment->{date_to}, and $payment->{ar_ap_accno}.

The $payment->{ar_ap_accno} property is used to filter out by AR or AP account.

The following can also be optionally passed: $payment->{batch_id}.  If this is
patched, vouchers in the current batch will be picked up as well.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{contact} property.
Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and entity_class.

=item get_payment_detail_data($request)

This method calls C<get_metadata()> to populate various object properties.
See that method's documentation for details.

Additionally a set of contact invoices properties are set,
filtered according to the supplied parameters.

C<$request> is a L<LedgerSMB> request object.

Required request parameters:

  * dbh
  * account_class [1|2]
  * batch_id

Optionally accepts the following filtering parameters:

  * currency [e.g. 'GBP']
  * ar_ap_accno
  * meta_number

Though the following filtering parameters appear to be available,
they are not supported by the underlying C<payment_get_all_contact_invoices>
database query:

  * business_id
  * date_from
  * date_to

  * cash_accno
  * currency
  * exchangerate
  * payment_date

The C<$data> hashref has the following keys:

=over

=item contacts

An arrayref of hashrefs holding details on payments per customer.
Each customer hash holds the following keys:

=over

=item id

The value associated with this key indicates whether the contact
was selected to be included in the payment batch (C<true>-ish means
selected).

=item paid

This key indicates whether the outstanding amount for all invoices
of this customer was paid (C<all>) or that only partial payment is
to be recorded (C<some>) -- note that the latter may mean either of
'all invoices, but only partially' as well 'only some invoices, but
full payment'.

=item source

The source system identifier for the payment transaction -- will be
used for automated reconciliation when possible.

=item invoices

An array reference to the invoices included in the payment, with
a hashref per included invoice. The per-invoice hashref has the
following keys:

=over

=item net

The amount to be posted in case the contact is set to have
full/complete payment (C<paid == 'all'>).
