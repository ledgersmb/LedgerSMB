LedgerSMB::DBOject::Payment - Payment Handling Back-end Routines for LedgerSMB

=head1 SYNOPSIS

Provides the functions for generating the data structures payments made in
LedgerSMB.   This module currently handles only basic payment logic, and does
handle overpayment logic, though these features will be moved into this module
in the near future.

=head1 METHODS

=over

=item LedgerSMB::DBObject::Payment->new()

Inherited from LedgerSMB::DBObject.  Please see that documnetation for details.

=item $payment->get_open_accounts()

This function returns a list of open accounts depending on the
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{accounts} property.
Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and entity_class.

An account is considered open if there are outstanding, unpaid invoices
attached to it.  Customer/vendor payment threshold is not considered for this
calculation.

=item $payment->get_all_accounts()

This function returns a list of open or closed accounts depending on the
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{accounts} property.

=item $payment->reverse()

This function reverses a payment.  A payment is defined as one source
($payment->{source}) to one cash account ($payment->{cash_accno}) to one date
($payment->{date_paid}) to one vendor/customer ($payment->{credit_id},
$payment->{account_class}).  This reverses the entries with that source.

=item $payment->get_open_invoices()

This function returns a list of open invoices depending on the
$payment->{account_class}, $payment->{entity_id}, and $payment->{curr}
properties.  Account classes follow the conventions above.  This list is hence
specific to a customer or vendor and currency as well.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{open_invoices}
property. Each hashref has the following keys:  invoice_id int, invnumber text,
invoice bool, invoice_date date, amount numeric, amount_fx numeric,
discount numeric, discount_fx numeric, due numeric, due_fx numeric,
 exchangerate numeric

=item $payment->get_open_invoice()

This function is an especific case of get_open_invoices(), because get_open_invoice()
can search for a specific invoice, which can be searched by the $payment->{invnumber}
variable

=item $payment->get_all_contact_invoices()

This function returns a list of open accounts depending on the
$payment->{account_class} property.  If this property is 1, it returns a list
of vendor accounts, for 2, a list of customer accounts are returned.  Attached
to each account is a list of open invoices.  The data structure is somewhat
complex.

Each item in the list has the following keys: contact_id, contact_name, \
account_number, total_due, and invoices.

The invoices entry is a reference to an array of hashrefs.  Each of these
hashrefs has the following keys: invoice_id, invnumber, invoice_date, amount,
discount, and due.

These are filtered based on the (required) properties:
$payment->{account_class}, $payment->{business_type}, $payment->{date_from},
$payment->{date_to}, and $payment->{ar_ap_accno}.

The $payment->{ar_ap_accno} property is used to filter out by AR or AP account.

The following can also be optionally passed: $payment->{batch_id}.  If this is
patched, vouchers in the current batch will be picked up as well.

The returned list of hashrefs is stored in the $payment->{contact} property.
Each hashref has the following keys:  id (entity id), name, and entity_class.

=item post_bulk

This function posts the payments in bulk.  Note that queue_payments is not a
common setting and rather this provides a hook for an add-on.

This API was developed early in 1.3 and is likely to change for better
encapsulation.  Currenty it uses the following structure:

Within the main hashref:

=over

=item contact_count

The number of payments.  One per contact.

=item contact_$row

for (1 .. contact_count), contact_$_ is the entity credit account's id
associated with the current contact.  We will call this $contact_id below.

For each contact id, we have the following, suffixed with _$contact_id:

=over

=item source

=item invoice_count

Number of invoices to loop through

=item invoice_${contact_id}_$row

for $row in (1 .. invoice_count), each this provides the transaction id of the
invoice.

=back

Each invoice has the following attributes, suffxed with
${invoice_id}

=over

=item amount

=item paid

=item net

=back

=back

In the future the payment posting API will become more standardized and the
conversion between flat and hierarchical representation will be moved to the
workflow scripts.
