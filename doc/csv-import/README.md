# CSV import format documentation

Notes about the format:

* All CSV files start with the column headings on the first row
* Column separator is a comma (,)
* Numbers are parsed using the number format of the importing user(!)
  **Caveat**: if the importing user uses a comma as the decimal separator,
  a different format has to be selected temporarily during the import

## Chart of Accounts

The import of the chart of accounts should list the following columns,
in order:

* accno
  The number (field: alphanumeric) by which an account or heading
  is identified.
* description
  The text to show for the account. Usually a few words.
* charttype
  'A' when the line is an Account, 'H' when the line is a Heading
* category
  'L' for liability account, 'Q' for equity account, 'A' for asset account,
  'E' for expense account or 'I' for income account
* contra
  '0' for false, '1' for true; indicating that the account is a contra
  account -- i.e. an account offsetting another one in its own category.
  An example of a contra account is the 'cumulative depreciation' account
  which offsets the account holding the purchase value of an asset.
* tax
  '0' for false, '1' for true; indicating that the account is to be
  associated with a sales tax or VAT rate.
* link
  This is a list concatenated values specifying account properties; e.g.
  'AP_paid:AR_paid:IC_taxservice'. The full list of available identifiers
  is described in https://book.ledgersmb.org/1.3/split-book/sec-coa-account-configuration.html;
  please note that that section is written with a user looking at the account
  configuration screen (General Journal > Add account) in mind.
* heading
  The 'accno' of the heading to be associated with this row; please note
  that accounts *require* headings and headings *may have* a heading of
  their own.
* gifi_accno
  Generally not applicable: GIFI is required in Canada. This field can be used
  to associate an alternative account number.

The import is sensitive to the order in which accounts are being imported: each
account must reference a heading and the referenced heading must exist (i.e.
be imported on an earlier import run or on a prior line).

# General Ledger

## Single transaction

## Batch of transactions

This functionality imports a batch of 2-line transaction. Each line in the csv has
the following columns:

* debit_accno
  GL account code (accno) associated with the line representing the debit row in
  the transaction
* credit_accno
  GL account code (accno) associated with the line representing the debit row in
  the transaction
* amount
  The (functional currency) amount in the transaction; posted both on the credit
  and debit side of the transaction -- uses the same number format as configured
  for the uploading user
* curr
  The currency code of the transaction; if the transaction is local (functional)
  currency only, set this field to the default currency code (i.e. if the
  functional currency is USD and the transaction is in USD, fill the field with
  USD)
* amount_fx
  The transaction currency amount; if the transaction is functional currency,
  use the same amount as the "amount" column -- uses the same number format as
  configured for the uploading user
* reference
  The reference number to use for the transaction
* transdate
  The transaction date to be used, in the same date format as configured in the
  user-settings of the user uploading the file
* description
  The description field of the transaction
* source_debit
  The value of the "Source" field to be used for the debit row of the transaction
* source_credit
  The value of the "Source" field to be used for the credit row of the transaction
* memo
  The value of the "Memo" field to be used on the credit and debit rows of the
  transaction

Uploaded batches can be approved through "Transaction Approval > Batch".

# Parts (Goods & Services)

In LedgerSMB there exist 4 types of "parts":

1. Goods / Parts
2. Services
3. Overhead
4. Assemblies

At the time of writing (2020-07-29), no import exists for the Bill-of-Materials
part of assemblies. Contact the project through its mailing lists in case you
need it.

The same applies to parts translations: part descriptions which can be used
for international sales.
