Upgrading from version 1.6 to 1.8

1. make a backup copy of your databases and SQL-Ledger, just in case!
   $ cd /usr/local/www/sql-ledger
   $ pg_dump database > db.out
   $ tar cvf ~/sql-ledger.tar .
   
2. install LedgerSMB over top of your old installation
   $ cd /usr/local/www
   $ tar zxvf sql-ledger-1.8.0.tar.gz
   
3. change the tables to the new layout
   $ cd sql-ledger/sql
   $ psql database < upgrade-1.6-1.8.sql

4. copy the new master templates to your template directory
   $ cd ../templates

   $ cp Default-email_purchase_order.html your_template_dir/email_purchase_order.html
   $ cp Default-purchase_order.html your_template_dir/purchase_order.html
   $ cp Default-email_sales_order.html your_template_dir/email_sales_order.html
   $ cp Default-sales_order.html your_template_dir/sales_order.html
 
5. Two new accounts were hopefully added to your chart of accounts
   One account for Foreign Exchange Gains and one for
   Foreign Exchange Losses
   edit and change to suit your COA. You can safely change
   the account number too.
      
6. Edit your preferences

   In field 'Stylesheet' enter -> sql-ledger.css
   Stylesheet is in the css directory

   Add your foreign currencies in the Currencies field
   The first currency in the list is your default
   i.e CDN:USD:EUR:YEN
   If you used a nativecurr than it should be listed in the
   new currencies field.

7. <%nativecurr%> has changed to <%currency%>
   edit all your templates and change nativecurr to currency

8. I also added four more variables which can be used in your templates.
   <%contact%>, <%shiptocontact%>, <%shiptophone%>, <%shiptofax%>
   
9. Nameing convention for templates has changed from an
   underscore to a minus sign. If you designed your own
   master templates rename the templates from
   industry_invoice.html to industry-invoice.html,
   industry_packing_list.html to industry-packing_list.html, etc.
   The minus sign is used to separate the name and list them in
   the setup screen.
   
   This change only applies to the master templates in the
   templates root directory NOT the individual templates which
   are used by users.

It looks more than it really is. Steps 1 to 4 are important,
the rest is for fine tuning and info.
