\part{Template Syntax}

As in \lsmb 1.2, templating directives in \version{ }are expressed with the base
form of \pitag{foo}.  That, and basic variable substitution, is about the only
part of templating that has remained unchanged.  Starting with 1.3, the primary
rendering engine is Template Toolkit, with START\_TAG changed to
``\textless?lsmb'' and END\_TAG changed to ``?\textgreater''.

\section{Variable Substitution}
For simple output, the name of the variable is placed on its own, as in
\pitag{foo}.  Hash elements are accessed using the form \pitag{hash.key}. 
Arrays are treated as a form of hash where the key is the index of the element,
indexed from zero.  In more complex cases, such as where the desired hash key
is the value of another variable, values can be extracted by prefixing the name
of the other variable with \$.  This results in the form \pitag{row.\$column}.

Through Template Toolkit, \lsmbt{ }has the concept of private variables.  If
any component of the variable name starts with an underscore, it is private and
will not be output to the rendered document.

Something to watch for when dealing with variable substitution for hashes is
that in some cases, the key name conflicts with one of TT's VMethods for the
type.  When that occurs and the value is not defined, the VMethod is executed
instead of retrieving the value.  An example of where this could happen is when
retreiving the value of form.sort.  As it is often undefined and included in
``hidden'' HTML elements, it can cause application errors when a templater
attempts to retrieve it using form.sort instead of form.item('sort').

\section{Functions}

\subsection{Internationalisation}
In addition to the regular Template Toolkit functions, \lsmb has the
additional functions text and gettext.  Both of these functions are interfaces
to the underlying gettext infrastructure and both can handle simple gettext
substitutions.  The difference between these functions is that text makes use
of the locale of the current user, while gettext must be passed a string that
identifies one of the gettext translations.

These gettext lookups can take placeholders in the same syntax that the
underlying Perl does, ``[\_\emph{n}]''.  The output of the i18n functions is
not escaped and the input values are not unescaped.

\pitag{gettext('fr\_CA', 'Item \#[\_1]', value)}

\subsection{Formatting}

The only formatting function that is added is \emph{escape}.  The escape
function escapes a value using the rules for the template format.

\section{Control Structures}

\section{Debugging}
Two template-side tools that can help with debugging are the interface to
Data::Dumper and setting a debug message format.

\subsection{Variable Dumping}
The Data::Dumper interface is loaded using \pitag{USE dumper()} and used with
either \pitag{dumper.dump(\emph{var})} or \pitag{dumper.dump\_html(\emph{var})}.
Both dumper.dump and dumper.dump\_html perform the same basic dumping, however
dump\_html also escapes the values and applies basic formatting.  See
Template::Plugin::Dumper for details.

\subsection{Line Specification}
Template Toolkit has a DEBUG directive that can cause line-based logging
messages to appear in the rendered output when the debug flag to \lsmbt{ }is
true.   A sample tag to start a debugging region with \LaTeX{ }templates is
\pitag{DEBUG format '\% \$file:\$line \$text'}.  The debugging messages will
start with the line that has the directive and a debugging region can be
optionally terminated with \pitag{DEBUG format ''}, which tells TT to use an
empty message.

\part{The Templating API}
\section{\lsmbt}
A new templating API was added in \lsmb 1.3.  This API is accessed through
\lsmbt, and has several support modules.  Typical usage of this API is fairly
simple in that most places that use it instantiate a \lsmbt{ }object in
auto-output mode then use the resulting object's render method.  The
constructor options are detailed in the POD for \lsmbt{ }with the most
interesting one for designing and testing user interface templates probably
being ``debug'', which enables the display of debugging messages.  The render
method handles escaping the passed in template data for the selected output
format and the actual rendering with the appropriate support module.

\subsection{Input}
\subsection{Output}

\section{\lsmbt{ }Support Modules}
\subsection{\lsmbt::LaTeX}
This module uses Template::Latex to generate DVI, PDF, or Postscript output.
It looks for template files that end in ``.tex'' and take marked-up \LaTeX.
Rendering of templates by these modules happens in two phases: the TT phase
and the \LaTeX phase.  All templates that are directly called by \lsmbt{ }that
use these modules must be enclosed by the tag pair \pitag{FILTER latex} and
\pitag{END} for the second rendering phase to occur.  The final output file
format is determined by the format\_option filetype.

\subsection{\lsmbt::HTML}
This is the most frequently used \lsmbt{ }module as the migration of the user
interface to templates has started.  It looks for template files that end in
``.html''.

\subsection{\lsmbt::CSV}
A new form of output with \lsmb 1.3, this module is used by some reports to
give output in a standard form.  It looks for template files that end in
``.csv''.

\subsection{\lsmbt::ODS, \lsmbt::XLS}
This pair of module outputs spreadsheets.  Their input is specially formatted
XML files that are processed by TT before the final conversion from XML to
their respective formats.  Details about the XML format are available in the
documentation for Excel::Template.

The templates used by these modules have the extensions ``.odst'' and
``.xlst''.

\subsection{\lsmbt::TXT}
A format infrequently used by \lsmbn, this is used for Point Of Sale invoices.
It looks for templates that end in ``.txt''.

\subsection{\lsmbt::TTI18N}
This module defines some internationalisation functions that can be called in
templates that use Template Toolkit.

\subsection{\lsmbn::Mailer}
This module provides the functions used by \lsmbt{ }and the backup routines
in the administration module to email files and documents.
