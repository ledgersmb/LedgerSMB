RELEASE NOTES
LedgerSMB 1.2.14



1:  Welcome to LedgerSMB

LedgerSMB is an accounting and ERP program initially aimed at small to midsize
businesses.  Currently the financials and supply chain management modules are
fairly complete, while other modules such as project management exist in a
rudamentary form.  The initial features are identical to SQL-Ledger 2.6.17 from
which it was derived, but the feature set is starting to diverge rapidly.

1.1 System Requirements:

* Perl 5.8.
* Apache, IIS, or other web server that supports CGI.
* PostgreSQL 8.0 or higher.  7.3 and 7.4 could be supported with some effort but
will not work out of the box.  8.3 is expected to raise issues but they will be 
corrected as we become aware of the problems.
* Any operating system that supports the above environment.
* The following CPAN modules:
	* Data::Dumper
	* Locale::Maketext
	* Locale::Maketext::Lexicon
	* MIME::Base64
	* Digest::MD5
	* HTML::Entities
	* DBI
	* DBD::Pg
	* Math::BigFloat
	* IO::File
	* Encode
	* Locale::Country
	* Locale::Language
	* Time::Local
	* Cwd
	* Config::Std
	* MIME::Lite

	

2:  What's New in 1.2?

2.1: Database changes:

All core tables now have defined primary keys.  This allows Slony-I to be 
supported out of the box.

Chris Browne has contributed a setup script for Slony.  It is in the 
utils/replication directory.

Also all user information has been moved into the database and the password 
algorythm has been changed from crypt to md5.  This means that users will need 
to convert their accounts prior to first login on the new system (if this is an
upgrade).

Also now the defaults table has moved from a one column per value structure to a simple key->value structure.


2.2:  Security

LedgerSMB 1.2 has been through a detailed SQL injection audit of the codebase
inherited from SQL-Ledger.  As a result several vulnerabilities which were known
to be exploitable were corrected along with hundreds of places where
vulnerabilities may have been exploitable but we didn't have time to verify the
what was involved in exploiting it.  We believe though that many or most of the
issues were exploitable given a little time and effort.

Also, we discovered the template editor's security system was moved from
blacklisting to whitelisting, eliminating a whole class of possible security
issues.

2.3:  New Features in 1.2.x

Metatron Technology Consulting's SL-POS codebase was merged with this project,
providing a framework for POS hardware support and more.

Online credit card processing support has been added.

LSMB now supports an arbitrary number of defined currencies for a business and 
is no longer limited to 3.

2.4:  Localization Changes

Localization functions now use Gettext .po files on all platforms.  This means 
that standard translation management tools will work with LSMB translations.

2.5:  Other changes

The ledger-smb.conf is now an inifile which will reduce the level of expertise 
necessary to configure it for non-Perl users.

3:  Known Issues

3.1: Reposting Invoices:
Reposting invoices is known to cause inaccuracies cost of goods sold and
inventory accounts.  This problem has been confirmed to affect SQL-Ledger 2.6.x 
as well and is caused by problems involving the de-allocation and trasaction
reversal routines.  It will be corrected (by removing the ability to truly
repost invoices) in an upcoming version as we continue to re-engineer the
application.

Additionally there is a known issue where reposting invoices more than once causes
a primary key issue on the transactions table.  A fix for this is distributed in
sql/fixes.

3.2: Tax rate changes
LedgerSMB 1.2.x's database structure does not handle tax rate changes properly.  A 
fix for this is in the sql/fixes directory.

3.3: Warehouse Tracking
LedgerSMB inherited an issue from SQL-Ledger where a shipped sales order deletes all
known shipping information.  There is a fix for this in the sql/fixes directory.

3.4: Recurring transactions
LedgerSMB's database structure does not handle certain areas properly regarding 
recurring transactions.  A fix for this issue is in the sql/fixes directory.

3.5: AR/AP Transactions
LedgerSMB from 1.2.0 through 1.2.13 had a bug which saved incorrect summary information for AR and AP transactions (but not invoices).  A fix for this has been included in sql/fixes and new transactions are not affected as of 1.2.14.

4:  Differences between LedgerSMB and SQL-Ledger(TM)

4.1: Login name restrictions
Logins in SQL-Ledger can contain any printable characters.  In LedgerSMB these
are restricted to alphanumeric characters and the symbols ., @, and -.

4.2: Session handling
SQL-Ledger as of 2.6.17 used session tokens for authentication.  These tokens
are based on the current timestamp and therefore insecure.  Furthermore, these
tokens are not tracked on the server, so one can easily forge credentials for
either the main application or the administrative interface.  While this was 
corrected in 2.6.18, the solutions chosen by SQL-Ledger (caching the crypted 
password by the browser) is not in line with commonly accepted best security
practices.

LedgerSMB stores the sessions in the database.  These are generated as md5 sums
of random numbers and are believed to be reasonably secure.  The sessions time
out after a period of inactivity.  In the initial release both
SQL-Ledger-style session ID's and the newer version were required to access the
application.  In newer versions, the SQL-Ledger style session ID's have been 
removed.

4.3: Database Changes
Under certain circumstances where the Chart of Accounts is improperly modified,
it is possible to post transactions such that a portion of the transaction is
put into a NULL account.  LedgerSMB does not allow NULL values in the chart id
field of the transaction.

Also, the transaction amount has been changed from FLOAT to NUMERIC so that
arbitrary precision mathematics can be used in third party reports.  This ought
to also allow SQL-Ledger to properly scale up better as SUM operations on
floating points are unsafe for large numbers of records where accounting data is
involved.

5:  Roadmap
This project has no defined roadmap but rather a set of statements and 
objectives contained in the documentation manager and trackers of sourceforge.
In general, our development is focused around the following principles:

* LSMB as infrastructure:  LSMB should be accessible from other applications.

* Universal applicability:  LSMB should be usable by any any business and should
always do the right thing in the background.  Businesses should never find that 
they have outgrown the software.

* Focus on Small to Midsize Businesses:  LSMB's core market will remain in the
small to midsize market.

6:  Get Involved
Contributors should start by joining the LedgerSMB users and devel lists.  Code
contributions at the moment must be committed by either project maintainer and
should be submitted either using the patches interface at Sourceforge or the
devel mailing lists.

Additionally, we can use help in QA, documentation, advocacy, and many other
places.

DEPRECATIONS:
=============================
The entire set of Perl modules and database structures should be seen as 
deprecated from the perspective of add-on development.  For advice in making
add-ons as upgrade-safe as possible, please email the -devel list.  Please 
include a description of what you are trying to accomplish.

KNOWN ISSUES:
==============================
The POS printing system gives an access denied message because the printer
triggers the directory transversal checks.  To work around this problem, ensure
that you do not need to use absolute paths for the printer program (use lpr or
put netdirect.pl in /usr/local/bin and reference without the full path).

Also the POS system requires some additional configuration both in the chart of 
accounts and in the system itself.  Please edit the pos.conf.pl and create 
appropriate till accounts.

Bugs Fixed in 1.2.6:
================================
1) Customer_id field not found error when posting AP transaction.  This error 
was caused by a mistake in the performance optimizations made in 1.2.5.

2) Erroneous headers printed to balance sheet and income statement.

3) Meta tags were added to force UTF-8 charsets, fixing occasional display
issues with multibyte characters where Apache was misconfigured.

4) ledgersmb-httpd.conf is now more internally consistant.  The alias directive
was changed to /ledgersmb (from /ledger-smb).

5) Minor html fixes were added to ca.pl, contributed by Donna Robertson

6) Error when searching for customer by address is corrected. 

7) Invalid format for integer error fixed when saving projects unconnected to 
customers.

None of the above fixes involved changes to API's that are widely used by the 
application.  Impacts elsewhere from these bug fixes should be minimal.

8) Unbound placeholder error when saving items with custom fields.  This error
involved a centrally used API that is invoked when custom fields exist.  The fix
is only likely to affect those installations which have custom fields attached
to orders, invoices, or parts.
